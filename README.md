# Github Improvement

## What's this?
Github Improvement is a browser extension that adds some features and improvements that we might be needed to have on GitHub website.

## What are those features and improvements?
We improve things that users need more, you should fill an issue and ask for a feature or improvement, and other people will vote for it, 
and we will work on those feature requests. [Let us know What should GitHub have?](https://github.com/m98/github-improvement/issues/new)

## Current improvements/changes:
* Show user profile pictures when they do something (news feed)

We are still working on the project, but we need your help, if you know TypeScript, or you want to learn it, you should contribute
on this project.
